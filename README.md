# Setup

`rosters` has no external dependency aside from a functioning OS. Simply
download the appropriate executable for your platform from the [release
page](https://github.com/macthecadillac/rosters/releases) and run in the
terminal.

# Usage

This program has a "multitool" interface, where the main command is followed by a
subcommand, which takes its own arguments. The general syntax of the tool is
`rosters <subcommand> <arguments> [options]`. The subcommands will be described
in the following subsections.

Run `rosters --help` and `rosters generate --help` to see the correct syntax and
a full list of available options.

## generate
    
This subcommand generates random rosters for every section in the lab. Go to
Canvas course > Grades > Actions > Export Entire Gradebook. Save the CSV file
somewhere in your system. Run `rosters generate --lab 1 --input
/path/to/data.csv`, replacing '1' with the lab number of the week and the last
part with the actual path to the CSV file. If your path contains spaces, you
will need to either escape the spaces or put the entire path in between quotes.
This will generate randomized rosters for every section in the current working
directory along with an xlsx file mirroring the pdfs for data entry purposes.
You can specify checkpoints for the lab through the configuration file.

## configure

`rosters configure` opens the configuration file in the default text editor.

## reset

`rosters reset` removes the configuration file (if any).

# Configuration

On Windows, the configuration file is located at
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\rosters.txt`. On Unix (such as macOS)/Unix-like (such as
Linux) systems with the environmental variable `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` set, the
configuration file is located at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rosters.txt`, otherwise it
is located at `$HOME/.config/rosters.txt`, where `$HOME` is your home folder.

The configuration is done via the TOML language. Here is a sample configuration
with all the recognized keys:

```toml
# This is an example configuration to help you get started. This file is
# already written to the correct location, so once you are done editing it,
# simply save and close your text editor. You can always access this file by
# running `rosters configure`. To remove the configuration, simply run
# `rosters reset`.

# Configuration is entirely optional. `rosters` will run
# with default values if a given configuration key is not found.

# This file is written in the TOML format. Lines prefixed with the "#" sign
# are comments and will be ignored.

[ta-assignment]
# LHS is the name of the TA. There cannot be spaces within a name.
# RHS is the list of sections that the TA is assigned to. It must be a list of
# integers separated by commas.
Joe = [38, 40]
Donny = [17, 19, 29, 35]
Barry = [3, 21, 23, 33]
Walker = [7, 9, 28, 30]
Billy = [10, 18, 20, 36]
Herbert = [5, 13, 15, 25]
Ronny = [1, 11, 27, 31]
Jimmy = [2, 12, 22, 32]
Jerry = [6, 8, 16, 26]
Ricky = [4, 14, 24, 34]
Lyndon = [37, 39]

[checkpoints]
# LHS must be in the form of \"lab\" followed by an integer.
# RHS is a list of strings. Entries must be enclosed in single or double quotes
# separted by commas.
lab1 = ['A', 'B5', 'C1', 'C2']
lab2 = ['B5', 'B6', 'Part C7']
lab3 = ['A7b', 'B7', 'B8/B9', 'B12']
lab4 = ['A4', 'B6', 'D1', 'D2']
lab5 = ['A2', 'B2', 'After C5', 'C6']
lab6 = ['A', 'B5', 'C']
lab7 = ['A3', 'B6', 'B13', 'C10']
lab8 = ['A6', 'A12', 'B2', 'B7']
lab9 = ['A3', 'B2', 'B9', 'C4']
```

# Examples

```sh
# open configuration
$ rosters configure

# generate rosters from a Canvas exported CSV file
$ rosters generate --lab 1 --input /path/to/canvas.csv

# generate rosters from a Canvas exported CSV file, specifying output file
$ rosters generate --lab 2 -i /path/to/canvas.csv -o /path/to/output/directory
```

# Building from source
Compiling from source requires the following build tools:

|Tool|Version requirement|
|----|-----|
|Rust| >= 1.64.0|
|OCaml| =4.14.0|
